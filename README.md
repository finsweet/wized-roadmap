# Wized Roadmap

This is a place to discuss major changes to Wized â€” where 'major' implies significant changes either to public interfaces or internal implementation details, particularly those that could be controversial or involve breaking changes.

RFCs can be found in the [Discussions](https://github.com/finsweet/wized-rfcs/discussions) tab of this repository. Your ideas and comments are welcome!
